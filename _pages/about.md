I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jinan Xu](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8300/) and Prof. [Kaiyu Huang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/10144/). I am broadly interested in Multimodal Large Language Models, Natural Language Generation and Trustworthy Large Language Models.  
  
Before that, I obtained my Bachlor degree from the same Beijing Jiaotong University, majoring in Computer Science.

My research interests include: 
- 🖼️ **Fine-grained Visual Perception (e.g. Visual Grounding)**
- 💬 **Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models**
- 🧩 **The reliability and safety of LLM**
